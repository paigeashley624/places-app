# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# places = Place.create(name: "Le Bernardin", address: "155 W 51st")
# places = Place.create(name: "Crow Shy", address: "70 Pine St")
# places = Place.create(name: "Catch NYC", address: "21 9th Ave")
# places = Place.create(name: "Via Carota", address: "51 Grove St")
# places = Place.create(name: "Kiki's", address: "130 Division St")
# places = Place.create(name: "Los Tacos No. 1", address: "75 9th Ave")
